The people have asked and I have delivered. Here is the Shark. 

If you're on linux, add the path to this script to your .bashrc (just make sure it's actually executable first), then shark will greet you every time you open the terminal.

Alternatively you can give the script an alias, to call shark whenever you'd like to say hi :)
